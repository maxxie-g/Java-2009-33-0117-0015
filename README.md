# Prime Integer Testing
A simple Java program to test to see if integers are prime.
  This program will read an input file with integers until it encounters a 0. It then will test to see if the number is a prime. If it 
is, then it will print "n is a prime" where n is the number read and tested. If n fails the test, then it will print "n is not prime." Along with printing, it will write the output to an output file.
